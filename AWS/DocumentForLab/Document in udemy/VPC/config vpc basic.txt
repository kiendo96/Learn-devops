//Tạo VPC và các thành phần
1. VPC
2. Subnets
3. IGW
4. NAT GW
5. Route Table
6. VPC endpoint for S3, cấu hình route table private đi ra S3 Endpoint
7. Security Groups

//1.VPC
-> Create VPC => VPC only => IPV4 CIDR = 10.0.0.0/16

//2. Subnets
-> Create subnet -> Choose VPC created in previous -> create new subnet "public" => Choose "Availability Zone" -> Enter subnet CIDR "10.0.0.0/22"
    => Add new subnet "public"   -> Choose "Availability Zone" -> Enter subnet CIDR "10.0.4.0/22"
        => Add new subnet "private"   -> Choose "Availability Zone" -> Enter subnet CIDR "10.0.8.0/22"
            => Add new subnet "private"   -> Choose "Availability Zone" -> Enter subnet CIDR "10.0.12.0/22"

//3.Internet Gateway(free)
-> create internet Gateway -> action "Attach to VPC" -> choose "VPC in previous"

//4. Create Nat Gateway(Tinh tien)
-> create nat gateway -> choose "subnet public" -> Allocate Elastic IP

//5. Route Tables (Public and private)
*create route table public
-> create route table -> choose "VPC"
    => edit routes => add route to internet "0.0.0.0/0" attach to internet gateway
        => subnet associations => edit subnet associations => choose two subnet public
*create route table private
-> create route table -> choose "VPC"
    => edit routes => add route to internet "0.0.0.0/0" attach to nat gateway

//6. VPC endpoint for S3
-> Create endpoint -> Services "S3" => type Gateway => choose VPC => Route table "private route table"

//7.Create security Groups
=> Create new security group => name: "public-sg" => attach to "VPC in previous" => inbound rules "HTTPS"
    => Create new SG for "bastion" -> name: "public-bastion" => attach to "VPC in previous" => inbound rules "SSH"
        => Create new SG for "app-sg" -> name: "public-app-sg" => attach to "VPC in previous" => inbound rules "HTTP" => Source "public-sg" => inbound rules "SSH" => source "public bastion"
            => Create new SG for "database-sg" -> name: "public-database-sg" => attach to "VPC in previous" => open "TCP"port 9200 and "MYSQL Aurora" 3306 => source from app-sg => "MYSQL Aurora" 3306 => source from bastion-sg

Test VPC:
1. create 1 new instance
=> create a new instance => attach vpc in previous lab -> subnet "public" => choose security group for "bastion"
    => create a new Elastic IPs -> Allocate elastic ip address to bastion server
