////Ingress Architecture
- Ingress object
- ingress controller


///Ingress overview
- API object
- Defines rules for external access to Services (Định nghĩa rules access cho services)
- Loadbalancing to endpoint
- Name-based virtual hosts
- Path-based routing
- TLS termination
=> Managing Ingress Traffic pattern for kubernetes services

///Why ingress Rather Than LoadBalancer
- Layer 7 (Có header dễ dàng manage và control)
- Path-based routing (Cơ chế path /)
- Name-based routing (Gán host name)
- Higher level capabilities
- Single resource (chỉ 1 resource)
- Reduced latency (Giảm chi phí và độ trễ)
