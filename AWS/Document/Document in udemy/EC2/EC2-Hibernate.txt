- We know we can stop, terminate instances
    + Stop: the data on disk(EBS) is kept intact in the next start
    + Terminate: any EBS volumes (root) also set-up to be destroyed is lost

- On start, the following happens:
    + First start: the OS boots & the EC2 User Data script is run
    + Following starts: the OS boots up
    + Then your application starts, caches get warmed up, and the can take time

//Introducing EC2 Hibernate:
- The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
- The instance boot is much faster(the OS is not stopped/restarted)
- Under the hood: The RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume
- The root EBS volume must be encrypted
- Use cases: 
    + Long-running processing
    + Saving the RAM state
    + Services that take time to initialize

//Good to know
- Supported instance families: C3, C4, C5, I3, M3, R3, R4,, T2, T3...
- Instance RAM size: must be less than 150GB
- Instance size: not supported for bare metal instances
