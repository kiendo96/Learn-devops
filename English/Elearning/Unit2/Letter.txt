Dear Mrs.Quyet,
Right Now, I'm studying English in my house and my teacher requires me to write this email. I will let you know about my holiday.
Last Sunday, I was traveling with my friend in Da Nang city. In the morning, we boarded the plane to Danang. After that, We visited about famous place such as: Hoi An, Ba Na Hills...
In the evening, when we were trying local food, we saw a lot of foreigners on the street. We took some photo with their.
Now I feel that we had a good journey. I hope you think so too. See you soon!
Love,
Kien
