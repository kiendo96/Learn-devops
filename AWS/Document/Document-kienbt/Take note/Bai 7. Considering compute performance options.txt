- Understand your workload
- understand AWS Compute
- Gather/analyze data
- test,test,test

//AWS compute option:
- EC2: Elastic Cloud Compute
- ECS: Elastic Container service
- AWS Lambda

//EC2
- Original/default option
- Virtualized servers
- Choose resources
- You own the OS

//EC2 General Resource
- vCPUs
- Memory
- Storage
- Network
- Burstable performance: privide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline
- GPU
- FPGA

//EC2 Instance type:
- General purpose
- Compute optimized
- Memory optimized
- Accelerated computing
- Storage optimized
- Bare metal


//EC2 Auto Scaling
- Metrics based
- Schedule based
- Health based


//ECS
- Similar workload as EC2
- Migrate apps to the cloud
- Long running apps
- Batch Processing
- Microservices

- Better utilize resources
- ELB
- Autoscaling
- AWS Fargate: Remove toan bo management voi phan behind the sence cua ECS. Scale se tu dong

//Lambda(Serverless)
- Backend Processing
- Event Processing
- Stream Processing
- Data Processing

- AWS resource triggers
- API endpoints
- Choose memory, get CPU
- Beware of limits

- Simply excute code
- Automatic Scaling
- Fault tolerant
- Pay for usage - really

//Apply Our knowledge

//Migrating to AWS Compute
- Portlolio of web applications
- Global presence
- Data Collection from clinical trials

*>Considerations for choice
- First of many
- Time to migrate
- Predictable usage

=>Lua chon ECS
    - Lift and shift
        + Easy to containerize
        + Able to scale
    - Size instances
    - Leverage for future applications

=>Build for the cloud
    - New web application
    - Match medical devices to needs
    - Global user base

*>Considerations for choise
- Manage costs
- Global reach
- Minimal maintenance
=> Use Lambda:
    - Services behind static site
    - Pay for runtime
    - Scales based on demand
    - Multiple regions
    - No servers to maintain
