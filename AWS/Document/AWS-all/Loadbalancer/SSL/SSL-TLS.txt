//Basic
- An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)
- SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer, used to encrypt connections
- TLS refers to Transport Layer Security, which is a newer version
- Nowadays, TLS certificate are mainly used, but people still refer as SSL
- Public SSL Certificates are issued by Certifacte Authorities (CA)
- Comdodo, Symantec, Godady, GlobalSign, Degicert, letsencrypt....
- SSL certificates have an expiration date (you set) and must be renewed

//SSL
- The load balancer uses an X.509 certificate (SSL/TLS server certificate)
- You can manage certificates using ACM (AWS certificate Manager)
- You can create upload your own certificates alternatively
- HTTPS listener:
    + You must specify a default certificate
    + You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
    + Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
    + Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL/TLS (legacy clients)

#Server Name Indication
- SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server (to serve multiple websites)
- It's a "newer" protocol and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in initial SSL handshake
- The server will then find the correct certificate or return the default one
Note:
- Only works for ALB & NLB (newer generation), CloudFront
- Does not work for CLB(older gen)

- Classic Load Balancer (v1):
    + Support only one SSL certificate
    + Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificate
- Application Load Balancer (V2):
    + Support multipe listener with multiple SSL certificates
    + Uses Server Name indication (SNI) to make it work
- Network Load Balancer (V2):
    + Support multiple listener with multiple SSL certificates
    + Uses Server Name Indication(SNI) to make it work
